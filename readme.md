# CMCL

 <img src="img/structure.png">

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine contrastive learning framework for UTAL, called CMCL, which consists of three hierarchical CL, namely video level, instance level, and feature-wise level, trained in an end-to-end multi-task manner. 

## Results

Comparison of state-of-the-art methods on the THUMOS'14 dataset in fully supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised learning settings, respectively. We denote the fully supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised as FS, WS, and US, respectively. The best results are in bold.
